\chapter{Presentation Rubric}\label{s:teacheval}

This rubric is designed to assess 5--10 minute recordings of people
teaching with slides, live coding, or a mix of both. You can use it as
a starting point for creating a rubric of your own. Rate each item as
``Yes'', ``Iffy'', ``No'', or ``Not Applicable''.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
