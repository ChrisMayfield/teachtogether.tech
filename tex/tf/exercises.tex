\chapter{Exercise Types}\label{s:exercises}

Every good carpenter has a set of screwdrivers, and every good teacher
has different kinds of formative assessment exercises to check what
learners are actually learning, help them practice their new skills, and
keep them engaged. This chapter starts by describing several kinds of
exercises you can use to check if your teaching has been effective. It
then looks at the state of the art in automated grading, and closes by
exploring discussion, projects, and other important kinds of work that
require more human attention to assess. Our discussion draws in part on
the \href{http://web-cat.org/questionbank/}{Canterbury Question Bank}
\cite{Sand2013}, which has entries for various languages and topics
in introductory computing.

\section{The Classics}\label{s:exercises-classics}

As Section~\ref{s:models-formative-assessment} discussed, \emph{multiple
choice questions} (MCQs) are most effective when the wrong answers probe
for specific misconceptions. In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy
(Section~\ref{s:process-objectives}), MCQs are usually designed to test
recall and understanding (``What is the capital of Saskatchewan?''), but
they can also require learners to exercise judgment.

\begin{aside}{A Multiple Choice Question}

In what order do operations occur when the computer evaluates the
expression \texttt{price\ =\ addTaxes(cost\ -\ discount)}?

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  subtraction, function call, assignment
\item
  function call, subtraction, assignment
\item
  function call, then assignment and subtraction simultaneously
\item
  none of the above
\end{enumerate}

\end{aside}

The second classic type of programming exercise is \emph{code and run}
(C\&R), in which the learner writes code that produces a specified
output. C\&R exercises can be as simple or as complex as the teacher
wants, but for in-class use, they should be brief and have only one or
two plausible correct answers. For novices, it's often enough to ask
them to call a specific function: experienced teachers often forget how
hard it can be to figure out which parameters go where. For more
advanced learners, figuring out which function to call is more engaging
and a better gauge of their understanding.

\begin{aside}{Code \& Run}

The variable \texttt{picture} contains a full-color image read from a file.
Using one function, create a black and white version of the image and
assign it to a new variable called \texttt{monochrome}.

\end{aside}

Write and run exercises can be combined with MCQs. For example, this MCQ
can only be answered by running the Unix \texttt{ls} command:

\begin{aside}{Combining MCQ with Code \& Run}

You are in the directory \texttt{/home/greg}. Which of the following files is
\emph{not} in that directory?

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \texttt{autumn.csv}
\item
  \texttt{fall.csv}
\item
  \texttt{spring.csv}
\item
  \texttt{winter.csv}
\end{enumerate}

\end{aside}

C\&Rs help learners practice the skills they most want to learn, but
they can be hard to assess: learners can find lots of unexpected ways to
get the right answer, and are demoralized if an automatic grading system
rejects their code because it doesn't match the instructor's. One way to
reduce how often this occurs is to assess only their output, but that
doesn't give them feedback on how they are programming. Another is to
give them a small test suite they can run their code against before they
submit it (at which point it is run against a more comprehensive set of
tests). Doing this helps them figure out if they have completely
misunderstood the intent of the exercise before they do anything that
they think might cost them grades.

Instead of writing code that satisfies some specification, learners can
be asked to write tests to determine whether a piece of code conforms to
a spec. This is a useful skill in its own right, and doing it may give
students a bit more sympathy for how hard their teachers work.

\begin{aside}{Inverting Code \& Run}

The function \texttt{monotonic\_sum} calculates the sum of each section of a
list of numbers in which the values are strictly increasing. For
example, given the input \texttt{{[}1,\ 3,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 1{]}}, the output is
\texttt{{[}4,\ 12,\ 1{]}}. Write and run unit tests to determine which of the
following bugs the function contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Considers every negative number the start of a new sub-sequence.
\item
  Does not include the first value of each sub-sequence in the
  sub-sum.
\item
  Does not include the last value of each sub-sequence in the
  sub-sum.
\item
  Only re-starts the sum when values decrease rather than fail to
  increase.
\end{itemize}

\end{aside}

\emph{Fill in the blanks} is a refinement of C\&R in which the learner is
given some starter code and has to complete it. (In practice, most C\&R
exercises are actually fill in the blanks because the teacher will
provide comments to remind the learners of the steps they should take.)
As discussed in Chapter~\ref{s:load}, novices often find filling in the
blanks less intimidating than writing all the code from scratch, and
since the teacher has provided most of the answer's structure,
submissions are much more predictable and therefore easier to check.

\begin{aside}{Fill in the Blanks}

Fill in the blanks so that the code below prints the string \texttt{\textquotesingle{}hat\textquotesingle{}}.

\begin{minted}{text}
text = 'all that it is'
slice = text[____:____]
print(slice)
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

As described in Chapter~\ref{s:load}, \gref{g:parsons-problem}{Parsons
Problems} also avoid the ``blank screen of terror''
problem. The learner is given the lines of code needed to solve a
problem, but has to put them in the right order. Research over the
past few years has shown that Parsons Problems are effective because
they allow learners to concentrate on control flow separately from
vocabulary
\cite{Pars2006,Eric2015,Morr2016,Eric2017}. The
same research shows that giving the learner more lines than she needs,
or asking her to rearrange some lines and add a few more, makes this
kind of problem significantly harder \cite{Harm2016}. Tools for
building and doing Parsons Problems online exist \cite{Ihan2011},
but they can be emulated (albeit somewhat clumsily) by asking learners
to rearrange lines of code in an editor.

\begin{aside}{Parsons Problem}

Rearrange and indent these lines to sum the positive values in a list.
(You will need to add colons in appropriate places as well.)

\begin{minted}{text}
total = 0
if v > 0
total += v
for v in values
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

\section{Tracing}\label{s:exercises-tracing}

\emph{Tracing execution} is the inverse of a Parsons Problem: given a few
lines of code, the learner has to trace the order in which those lines
are executed. This is an essential debugging skill, and is a good way to
solidify learners' understanding of loops, conditionals, and the
evaluation order of function and method calls. The easiest way to
implement it is to have learners write out a sequence of labelled steps.
Having them choose the correct sequence from a set (i.e., presenting
this as an MCQ) adds cognitive load without adding value, since they
have to do all the work of figuring out the correct sequence, then
search for it in the list of options.

\begin{aside}{Tracing Execution Order}

In what order are the labelled lines in this block of code executed?

\begin{minted}{text}
A)     vals = [-1, 0, 1]
B)     inverse_sum = 0
       try:
           for v in vals:
C)             inverse_sum += 1/v
       except:
D)         pass
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

\emph{Tracing values} is similar to tracing execution, but instead of
spelling out the order in which code is executed, the learner has to
list the values that one or more variables take on as the program runs.
It can also be implemented by having learners provide a list of values,
but another approach is to give the learner a table whose columns are
labelled with variable names and whose rows are labelled with line
numbers, and asking them to fill in all of the values taken on by all of
the variables.

\begin{aside}{Tracing Values}

What values do \texttt{left} and \texttt{right} take on as this program executes?

\begin{minted}{text}
left = 24
right = 6
while right:
    left, right = right, left % right
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

You can also require learners to trace code backwards, e.g., to figure
out what the input must have been if the code produced a particular
result \cite{Armo2008}. These \emph{reverse execution} problems require
search and deductive reasoning, but they are particularly useful when
the ``output'' is an error message, and help learners develop valuable
debugging skills.

\begin{aside}{Reverse Execution}

Fill in the missing number in \texttt{values} that caused this function to
crash.

\begin{minted}{text}
values = [ [1.0, -0.5], [3.0, 1.5], [2.5, ___] ]
runningTotal = 0.0
for (reading, scaling) in values:
    runningTotal += reading / scaling
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

\emph{Minimal fix} exercises also help learners develop debugging skills.
Given a few lines of code that contain a bug, the learner must either
make or identify the smallest change that will produce the correct
output. Making the change can be done using C\&R, while identifying it
can be done as a multiple choice question.

\begin{aside}{Minimal Fix}

This function is supposed to test whether a number lies within a
range. Make one small change so that it actually does so.

\begin{minted}{text}
def inside(point, lower, higher):
    if (point <= lower):
        return false
    elif (point <= higher):
        return false
    else:
        return true
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

\emph{Theme and variation} exercises are similar, but instead of making a
change to fix a bug, the learner is asked to make a small alteration
that changes the output in some specific way. Allowed changes can
include replacing one function call with another, changing one
variable's initial value, swapping an inner and outer loop, changing
the order of tests in a chain of conditionals, or changing the nesting
of function calls or the order in which methods are chained. Again, this
kind of exercise gives learners a chance to practice a useful real-world
skill: the fastest way to produce a working program is often to tweak
one that already does something useful.

\begin{aside}{Theme and Variations}

Change the inner loop in the function below so that it fills the upper
left triangle of an image with a specified color.

\begin{minted}{text}
function fillTriangle(picture, color) is
    for x := 1 to picture.width do
        for y := 1 to picture.height do
            picture[x, y] = color
        end
    end
end
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

\emph{Refactoring exercises} are the complement of theme and variation
exercises: given a working piece of code, the learner has to modify it
in some way \emph{without} changing its output. For example, the learner
could be asked to replace loops with vectorized expressions, to simplify
the condition in a while loop, etc. The exercise here is that there are
often so many ways to refactor a piece of code that grading requires
human intervention.

\begin{aside}{Refactoring}

Write a single list comprehension that has the same effect as this
loop.

\begin{minted}{text}
result = []
for v in values:
    if len(v) > threshold:
        result.append(v)
\end{minted}

\end{aside}

\section{Diagrams}\label{s:exercises-diagrams}

Having students draw concept maps and other diagrams gives insight into
how they're thinking (Section~\ref{s:memory-concept-maps}), but free-form
diagrams take human time and judgment to assess. \emph{Labelling diagrams},
on the other hand, is almost as useful from a pedagogical point of view
but much easier to scale.

Rather than having learners create diagrams from scratch, provide them
with a diagram and a set of labels and have them put the latter in the
right places on the former. The diagram can be a complex data structure
(``after this code is executed, which variables point to which parts of
this structure?''), the graph that a program produces (``match each of
these pieces of code with the part of the graph it generated''), the code
itself (``match each term to an example of that program element''), or
many other things; the key is that constraining the set of solutions
makes this usable in class and at scale.

\begin{aside}{Labelling a Diagram}

Figure~\ref{f:exercises-labelling} shows how a small fragment of HTML is represented in
memory. Put the labels 1--10 on the elements of the tree to show the
order in which they are reached in a depth-first traversal.

\end{aside}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{../../figures/labelling.pdf}
\caption{Labelling a Diagram}
\label{f:exercises-labelling}
\end{figure}

Another way to use diagrams for formative assessment is to give learners
the pieces of the diagram and ask them to arrange them correctly. This
is a visual equivalent of a Parsons Problem, and you can provide as much
or as little of a skeleton to help them with placement as you think
they're ready for. (I have fond memories of trying to place resistors
and capacitors in a circuit diagram in order to get the right voltage at
a certain point, and have often seen teachers give learners a fixed set
of Scratch blocks and ask them to create a particular drawing using only
those blocks.)

\emph{Matching problems} can be thought of as a special case of labelling in
which the ``diagram'' is a column of text and the labels are taken from
the other column. \emph{One-to-one matching} gives the learner two lists of
equal length and asks her to pair corresponding items, e.g., ``match each
piece of code with the output it produces''.

\begin{aside}{Matching}

Match each regular expression operator with what it does.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{?} & start of line\tabularnewline
\texttt{*} & zero or one occurrences\tabularnewline
\texttt{+} & end of line\tabularnewline
\texttt{\$} & one or more occurrences\tabularnewline
\texttt{\^{}} & zero or more occurrences\tabularnewline
\end{longtable}

\end{aside}

\emph{Many-to-many matching} is similar, but the lists aren't the same
length, so some items may be matched to several others, while others may
not be matched at all. Both kinds require learners to use higher-order
thinking skills, but many-to-many are more difficult because learners
can't do easy matches first to reduce their search space (i.e., there is
a higher cognitive load.)

Matching problems can be implemented by having learners submit lists of
matching pairs as text (such as ``A3, B1, C2''), but that's clumsy and
error-prone. Having them recognize a set of correct pairs in an MCQ is
even worse, as it's painfully easy to misread.

\emph{Ranking} is a special case of matching that is (slightly) more amenable
to answering via lists, since our minds are pretty good at detecting
errors or anomalies in sequences. Give the learner several items and ask
them to order them from fastest to slowest, most robust to most brittle,
and so on. The former tends toward recall (e.g., recognizing the names
of various sorting algorithms and knowing their properties), while the
latter tends more toward reasoning and judgment.

\emph{Summarization} also requires learners to use higher-order thinking, and
gives them a chance to practice a skill that is very useful when
reporting bugs rather than fixing them. For example, learners can be
asked, ``Which sentence best describes how the output of f changes as x
varies from 0 to 10?'' and then given several options as a multiple
choice question.

You can also ask for very short free-form answers to questions in
constrained domains, e.g., ``What is the key feature of a stable sorting
algorithm?'' We still can't fully automate checks for these without a
frustrating number of false positives (accepting wrong answers) and
false negatives (rejecting correct ones), but they lend themselves well
to peer grading (Section~\ref{s:individual-peer}).

\section{Automatic Grading}\label{s:exercises-grading}

Automatic program grading tools have been around longer than I've been
alive: the earliest published mention dates from 1960
\cite{Holl1960}, and the surveys published in
\cite{Douc2005,Ihan2010} mention many specific tools by name.
Building such tools is a lot more complex than it might first seem. How
are assignments represented? How are submissions tracked and reported?
Can learners co-operate? How can submissions be executed safely?
\cite{Edwa2014a} is an entire paper devoted to an adaptive scheme for
detecting and managing infinite loops and other non-terminating code
submissions, and that's just one of the many issues that comes up.

As elsewhere, it's important to distinguish learner satisfaction from
learning outcomes. \cite{Magu2018} switched informal programming labs
to a weekly machine-evaluated test for a second-year CS course using an
auto-grading tool originally developed for programming competitions.
Learners didn't like the automated system, but the overall failure rate
for the course was halved, and the number of learners gaining first
class honors tripled. In contrast, \cite{Rubi2014} also began to use
an auto-grader designed for competitions, but saw no significant
decrease in their learners' dropout rates; once again, learners made
some negative comments about the tool, which the authors attribute to
its feedback messages rather than to dislike of auto-grading.

\cite{Srid2016} took a different approach. They used
\gref{g:fuzz-testing}{fuzz testing} (i.e., randomly-generated
test cases) to check whether learner code does the same thing as a
reference implementation supplied by the teacher. In the first project
of a 1400-learner introductory course, fuzz testing caught errors that
were missed by a suite of hand-written test cases for more than 48\% of
learners, which clearly demonstrates its value.

\cite{Basu2015} gave learners a suite of solution test cases, but
learners had to unlock each one by answering questions about its
expected behavior before they were allowed to apply it to their proposed
solution. For example, suppose learners are writing a function to find
the largest adjacent pair of numbers in a list; before being allowed to
use the tests associated with this question, they have to choose the
right answer to, ``What does \texttt{largestPair(4,\ 3,\ -1,\ 5,\ 3,\ 3)} produce?''
(The correct answer is \texttt{(5,\ 3)}.) In a 1300-person university course,
the vast majority of learners chose to validate their understanding of
test cases this way before attempting to solve problems, and then asked
fewer questions and expressed less confusion about assignments.

It's tempting to use off-the-shelf style checking tools to grade
learners' code. However, \cite{Nutb2016} initially found no
correlation between human-provided marks and style-checker rule
violations. Sometimes this was because learners violated one rule many
times (thereby losing more points than they should have), and other
times it was because they submitted the assignment starter code with few
alterations and got more points than they should have.

\cite{Buff2015} presents a well-informed reflection on
the whole idea of providing automated feedback. Their starting point
is that, ``Automated grading systems help learners identify bugs in
their code, {[}but{]} may inadvertently discourage learners from thinking
critically and testing thoroughly and instead encourage dependence on
the teacher's tests.'' One of the key issues they identified is that a
learner may thoroughly test their code, but the feature may still not
be implemented according to the teacher's specifications. In this
case, the ``failure'' is not caused by a lack of testing, but by a
misunderstanding of the requirements, and it is unlikely that more
testing will expose the problem. If the auto-grading system doesn't
provide insightful, actionable feedback, this experience will only
frustrate the learner.

In order to provide that feedback, \cite{Buff2015}'s system
identifies which method or methods of the learner's code are executed by
failing tests, so that the system can associate failed tests with
particular features within the learner's submission. The system decides
whether specific hints have been ``earned'' by seeing whether the learner
has tested the associated feature enough, so learners cannot rely on
hints instead of doing tests.

\cite{Keun2016a,Keun2016b} classified the messages produced by 69
auto-grading tools. They found that these often do not give feedback on
how to fix problems and take the next step. They also found that most
teachers cannot easily adapt most of the tools to their needs; like many
workflow tools, they tend to enforce their creators' unrecognized
assumptions about how institutions work. Their work is ongoing, and
their detailed classification scheme is a useful shopping list when
looking at tools of this kind.

\cite{Srid2016} discussed strategies for sharing feedback with
learners when automatically testing their code. The first is to provide
the expected output for the tests---but then learners hard-code output for
those inputs (because anything that can be gamed, will be). An
alternative is to report the pass/fail results for the learners' code,
but only supply the actual inputs and outputs of the tests after the
submission date. This can be frustrating, because it tells learners they
are wrong, but not why.

A third option is to use a technique called \gref{g:hashing}{hashing} to
generate a value that depends on the output, but doesn't reveal it. If
the user produces exactly the same output, its hash will be the same
as the hash of the correct output, which will unlock the solution, but
it is impossible to work backward from the hash to figure out what the
output is supposed to be. Hashing is used to create digital signatures
for documents, and requires a bit more work and explanation to set up,
but strikes a good balance between revealing answers prematurely and
not revealing them when it would help.

\section{Higher-Level Thinking}\label{s:exercises-higher}

Many other kinds of programming exercises are hard for teachers to
assess in a class with more than few dozen learners, and equally hard
for automated platforms to assess at all. Larger programming projects,
or projects in which learners set their own goals, are (hopefully) what
classes are building toward. Free-form discussion or twitch coding
(Section~\ref{s:performance-live}) is also valuable, but also doesn't
scale.

\emph{Code review}, on the other hand, is hard to grade automatically in the
general case, but can be tackled if learners are given a rubric (e.g., a
list of faults to look for) and asked to match particular comments
against particular lines of code. For example, the learner can be told
that there are two indentation errors and one bad variable name, and
asked to point them out; if she is more advanced, she could be given
half a dozen kinds of remarks she could make about the code without
guidance as to how many of each she should find.

\cite{Steg2016b} is a good starting point for a code style rubric,
while \cite{Luxt2009} looks at peer review in programming classes
more generally. If you are going to have students do reviews, use
calibrated peer review (Section~\ref{s:individual-peer}) so that they
have models of what good feedback should look like.

\begin{aside}{Code Review}

Using the rubric provided, mark each line of the code below.

\begin{minted}{text}
01)  def addem(f):
02)      x1 = open(f).readlines()
03)      x2 = [x for x in x1 if x.strip()]
04)      changes = 0
05)      for v in x2:
06)          print('total', total)
07)          tot = tot + int(v)
08)      print('total')
\end{minted}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  poor variable name
\item
  unused variable
\item
  use of undefined variable
\item
  missing return value
\end{enumerate}

\end{aside}

\section{Exercises}\label{s:exercises-exercises}

\subsection*{Code and Run (pairs/10)}

Create a short C\&R exercise; trade with a partner, and see how long it
takes each of you to understand and do the other's exercise. Were there
any ambiguities or misunderstandings in the exercise description?

\subsection*{Inverting Code and Run (small groups/15)}

Form groups of 4--6 people. Have each member of the group create an
inverted C\&R exercise that requires people to figure out what input
produces a particular output. Pick two at random, and see how many
different inputs the group can find that satisfy the requirements.

\subsection*{Tracing Values (pairs/10)}

Write a short program (10--15 lines); trade with a partner, and trace how
the variables in the program change value over time. What differences
are there in how you and your partner wrote down your traces?

\subsection*{Refactoring (small groups/15)}

Form groups of 3--4 people. Have each person select a short piece of code
(10--30 lines long) that they have written that isn't as tidy as it could
be. Choose one at random, and have everyone in the group tidy it up
independently. How do your cleaned-up versions differ? How well or how
poorly would you be able to accommodate all of these variations if
marking automatically or in a large class?

\subsection*{Labelling a Diagram (pairs/10)}

Draw a diagram showing something that you have explained recently: how
browsers fetch data from servers, the relationship between objects and
classes, or how data frames are indexed in R. Put the labels on the
side, and ask your partner to place them.

\subsection*{Pencil-and-Paper Puzzles (whole class/15)}

\cite{Butl2017} describes a set of pencil-and-paper puzzles that can
be turned into introductory programming assignments, and found that
these assignments are enjoyed by students and encourage meta-cognition.
Think of a simple pencil-and-paper puzzle or game you played as a child,
and describe how you would turn it into a programming exercise.

\subsection*{Counting Failures (pairs/15)}

Any useful estimate of how much time an exercise needs must take into
account how frequent failures are and how much time is lost to them. For
example, editing text files seems like a simple task, but what about
finding those files? Most GUI editors save things to the user's desktop
or home directory; if the files used in a course are stored somewhere
else, a substantial fraction won't be able to navigate to the right
directory without help. (If this seems like a small problem to you,
please revisit the discussion of expert blind spot in
Chapter~\ref{s:memory}.)

Working with a partner, make a list of ``simple'' things you have seen go
wrong in exercises you have used or taken. How often do they come up?
How long do they take learners to fix on their own, or with help? How
much time do you currently budget in class to deal with them?
