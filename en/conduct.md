\chapter{Code of Conduct}\label{s:conduct}

\begin{callout}{Context}

  This code of conduct is based on the template written by the Ada
  Initiative and hosted on the
  \href{http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference\_anti-harassment/Policy}{Geek
    Feminism Wiki}.  We recommend that every online or in-person event
  adopt something like it, with the contact information filled in
  appropriately.  Please see ==section==s:joining-covenant== for the
  covenant governing contributions to this material.

\end{callout}

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.  We do not tolerate
harassment in any form, including offensive communication, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual
attention.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes
are not appropriate.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.  Anyone violating these rules may be asked to leave the
classroom at the sole discretion of the instructors.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that
you report it by emailing ADDRESS, or if the violation occurs during a
workshop or other in-person event, by contacting the host
directly at PHONE/TEXT. All reports will be kept confidential.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
