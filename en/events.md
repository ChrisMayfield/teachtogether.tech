# Checklists for Events

@@label@@s:events@@

[[Gawa2007](../bib/#Gawa2007)] popularized the idea that using checklists can save
lives (and make many other things better too). The results of recent
studies have been more nuanced [[Avel2013](../bib/#Avel2013),[Urba2014](../bib/#Urba2014)], but we still
find them useful, particularly when bringing new instructors onto a
team.

The checklists below are used before, during, and after instructor
training events, and can easily be adapted for end-learner workshops as
well. We recommend that every group build and maintain its own
checklists customized for its instructors’ and learners’ needs.

## Scheduling the Event

1.  Decide if it will be in person, online for one site, or online for
    several sites.

2.  Talk through expectations with the host(s) and make sure that
    everyone agrees on who is covering travel costs.

3.  Determine who is allowed to take part: is the event open to all
    comers, restricted to members of one organization, or something in
    between?

4.  Arrange instructors.

5.  Arrange space, including breakout rooms if needed.

6.  Choose dates. If it is in person, book travel.

7.  Get names and email addresses of attendees from host(s).

8.  Make sure they are added to the registration system.

## Setting Up

1.  Set up a web page with details on the workshop, including date,
    location, and a list of what participants need to bring.

2.  Check whether any attendees have special needs.

3.  If the workshop is online, test the video conferencing link.

4.  Make sure attendees will all have network access.

5.  Create an Etherpad or Google Doc for shared notes.

6.  Email attendees a welcome message that includes a link to the
    workshop home page, background readings, and a description of any
    prerequisite tasks.

## At the Start of the Event

1.  Remind everyone of the code of conduct.

2.  Collect attendance.

3.  Distribute sticky notes.

4.  Collect any relevant online account IDs.

## At the End of the Event

1.  Update attendance records. Be sure to also record who participated
    as an instructor or helper.

2.  Administer a post-workshop survey.

3.  Update the course notes and/or checklists.
