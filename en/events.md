\chapter{Checklists for Events}\label{s:events}

==cite==Gawa2007== popularized the idea that using checklists can save
lives (and make many other things better too). The results of recent
studies have been more nuanced ==cite==Avel2013,Urba2014==, but we
still find them useful, particularly when bringing new instructors
onto a team.

The checklists below are used before, during, and after instructor
training events, and can easily be adapted for end-learner workshops as
well. We recommend that every group build and maintain its own
checklists customized for its instructors' and learners' needs.

\section*{Scheduling the Event}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Decide if it will be in person, online for one site, or online for
  several sites.
\item
  Talk through expectations with the host(s) and make sure that everyone
  agrees on who is covering travel costs.
\item
  Determine who is allowed to take part: is the event open to all
  comers, restricted to members of one organization, or something in
  between?
\item
  Arrange instructors.
\item
  Arrange space, including breakout rooms if needed.
\item
  Choose dates. If it is in person, book travel.
\item
  Get names and email addresses of attendees from host(s).
\item
  Make sure they are added to the registration system.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Setting Up}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Set up a web page with details on the workshop, including date,
  location, and a list of what participants need to bring.
\item
  Check whether any attendees have special needs.
\item
  If the workshop is online, test the video conferencing link.
\item
  Make sure attendees will all have network access.
\item
  Create an Etherpad or Google Doc for shared notes.

  Email attendees a welcome message that includes a link to the workshop
  home page, background readings, and a description of any prerequisite
  tasks.
\end{enumerate}
