<p>As <a href="./pck.html">Chapter 7</a> explained, every teacher needs content knowledge, general pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge in order to be effective. We can elaborate this framework by adding technology to the mix [<a href="./bib.html#Koeh2013">Koeh2013</a>], but that doesn’t change the key point: it isn’t enough to know the subject, or how to teach—you have to know how to teach that particular subject [<a href="./bib.html#Maye2004">Maye2004</a>].</p>
<p>This chapter therefore focuses on one key aspect of teaching: giving a lecture or a live demonstration in front of a class. It isn’t the only way to teach, but it is probably the most common, and the techniques that will make you better at doing it can be applied elsewhere as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://csteachingtips.org/">CS Teaching Tips</a> site is collecting PCK for teaching programming, and I hope that one day we will have catalogs like [<a href="./bib.html#Ojos2015">Ojos2015</a>], teacher training materials like [<a href="./bib.html#Hazz2014">Hazz2014</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Guzd2015a">Guzd2015a</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Sent2018">Sent2018</a>], or more personal collections like [<a href="./bib.html#Gelm2002">Gelm2002</a>] to help us all do it better.</p>

<h2 id="s:performance-jugyokenkyu">8.1) Lesson Study</h2>
<p>From politicians to researchers and teachers themselves, educational reformers have designed systems to find and promote people who can teach well and eliminate those who cannot. But the assumption that some people are born teachers is wrong; instead, like any other performance art, the keys to better teaching are practice and collaboration. As [<a href="./bib.html#Gree2014">Gree2014</a>] explains, the Japanese approach to this is called <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:jugyokenkyu"><strong>jugyokenkyu</strong></a>, which means “lesson study”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jugyokenkyu</em> is a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft, from observing each other at work to discussing the lesson afterward to studying curriculum materials with colleagues. The practice is so pervasive in Japanese schools that it is<span>…</span>effectively invisible.</p>
<p>In order to graduate, <span>[</span>Japanese<span>]</span> education majors not only had to watch their assigned master teacher work, they had to effectively replace him, installing themselves in his classroom first as observers and then, by the third week, as a wobbly<span>…</span>approximation of the teacher himself. It worked like a kind of teaching relay. Each trainee took a subject, planning five days’ worth of lessons<span>…</span> <span>[</span>and then<span>]</span> each took a day. To pass the baton, you had to teach a day’s lesson in every single subject: the one you planned and the four you did not<span>…</span> and you had to do it right under your master teacher’s nose. Afterward, everyone—the teacher, the college students, and sometimes even another outside observer—would sit around a formal table to talk about what they saw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace in sports and music. A professional musician, for example, will dissect half a dozen different recordings of “Body and Soul” or “Smells Like Teen Spirit” before performing it. She would also expect to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after performances. Many other professions work this way as well: for example, the Japanese drew inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming">Deming’s ideas on continuous improvement in manufacturing</a>.</p>
<p>But continuous feedback isn’t part of teaching culture in most English-speaking countries. There, what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom: teachers don’t watch each other’s lessons on a regular basis, so they can’t borrow each other’s good ideas. The result is that <em>every teacher has to invent teaching on their own</em>. They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues, the school board or a textbook publisher, or go through a few MOOCs on the Internet, but each teacher has to figure out for herself how to combine that content with the theory she learned in education school to deliver an actual lesson in an actual classroom for actual students.</p>
<p>Writing up new techniques and giving <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:demonstration-lesson"><strong>demonstration lessons</strong></a>, in which one person teaches actual students while other teachers observe, seem like a way to solve this. However, [<a href="./bib.html#Finc2007">Finc2007</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Finc2012">Finc2012</a>] found that they are usually ineffective: of the 99 change stories analyzed, teachers only searched actively for new practices or materials in three cases, and only consulted published material in eight cases. Most changes occurred locally, without input from outside sources, or involved only personal interaction with other educators.</p>
<p>[<a href="./bib.html#Bark2015">Bark2015</a>] found something similar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adoption is not a “rational action,” however, but an iterative series of decisions made in a social context, relying on normative traditions, social cueing, and emotional or intuitive processes<span>…</span> Faculty are not likely to use educational research findings as the basis for adoption decisions<span>…</span> Positive student feedback is taken as strong evidence by faculty that they should continue a practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This phenomenon is sometimes called <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:lateral-knowledge-transfer"><strong>lateral knowledge transfer</strong></a>: someone sets out to teach X, but while watching them, their audience actually learns Y as well (or instead). For example, a teacher might intend to show learners how to search for email addresses in a text file, but what her audience might take away is some new keyboard shortcuts in the editor. What <em>jugyokenkyu</em> does is maximize the opportunity for this to happen between teachers.</p>
<h2 id="s:performance-feedback">8.2) Giving and Getting Feedback on Teaching</h2>
<p>Observing someone helps you; giving them feedback helps them. But as the cartoon in <a href="./performance.html#f:performance-feedback-feelings">Figure 8.1</a> suggests, it can be hard to receive feedback, especially when it’s negative.</p>

<figure>
<img src="./fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1: Feedback Feelings (copyright © Deathbulge 2013)" /><figcaption id="f:performance-feedback-feelings">Figure 8.1: Feedback Feelings (copyright <span>©</span> Deathbulge 2013)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Feedback is easier to give and receive when both parties share ground rules and expectations. This is especially important when they have different backgrounds or cultural expectations about what’s appropriate to say and what isn’t. You can get better feedback on your work by using these techniques:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Initiate feedback.</dt>
<dd><p>It’s better to ask for feedback than to receive it unwillingly.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Choose your own questions,</dt>
<dd><p>i.e., ask for specific feedback. It’s a lot harder for someone to answer, “What do you think?” than to answer either, “What is one thing I could have done as a teacher to make this lesson more effective?” or “If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what would it be?”</p>
<p>Directing feedback like this is also more helpful to you. It’s always better to try to fix one thing at once than to change everything and hope it’s for the better. Directing feedback at something you have chosen to work on helps you stay focused, which in turn increases the odds that you’ll see progress.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use a feedback translator.</dt>
<dd><p>Have someone else read over all the feedback and give you a summary. It can be easier to hear “It sounds like most people are following, so you could speed up” than to read several notes all saying, “this is too slow” or “this is boring”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Be kind to yourself.</dt>
<dd><p>Many of us are very critical of ourselves, so it’s always helpful to jot down what we thought of ourselves <em>before</em> getting feedback from others. That allows us to compare what we think of our performance with what others think, which in turn allows us to scale the former more accurately. For example, it’s very common for people to think that they’re saying “um” and “err” all the time, when their audience doesn’t notice it. Getting that feedback once allows teachers to adjust their assessment of themselves the next time they feel that way.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can give feedback to others more effectively as well:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Balance positive and negative feedback.</dt>
<dd><p>A common method is a “compliment sandwich” made up of one positive, one negative, and a second positive observation (though this can get tiresome after a while).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Organize your feedback using a rubric.</dt>
<dd><p>Most people are more comfortable giving and receiving feedback when they feel that they understand the social rules governing what they are allowed to say and how they are allowed to say it. A facilitator can then transcribe items into a shared document (or onto a whiteboard) during discussion.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The simplest rubric for feedback on teaching is a <span class="math inline">2 × 2</span> grid whose vertical axis is labelled “what went well” and “what can be improved”, and whose horizontal axis is labelled “content” (what was said) and “presentation” (how it was said). Observers write their comments on sticky notes as they watch the demonstration, then post those in the quadrants of a grid drawn on a whiteboard (<a href="./performance.html#f:performance-rubric">Figure 8.2</a>)</p>

<figure>
<img src="./fig/2x2-rubric.svg" /><figcaption id="f:performance-rubric">Figure 8.2: Teaching Rubric</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A more sophisticated rubric developed for assessing 5–10 minute videos of programming instruction is given in <a href="./teacheval.html">Appendix J</a>. A rubric this detailed is best presented as a checklist with items more or less in the order that they’ll be used (e.g., questions about the introduction come before questions about the conclusion).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question Budgets</strong></p>
<p>Rubrics like the one in <a href="./teacheval.html">Appendix J</a> have a tendency to grow over time as people think of things they’d like to add. A good way to keep them manageable is to insist that the total length stay constant, i.e., that if someone wants to add a question, they have to identify one that’s less important and can be removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in giving and getting feedback, [<a href="./bib.html#Gorm2014">Gorm2014</a>] has good advice that you can use to make peer-to-peer feedback a routine part of your teaching, while [<a href="./bib.html#Gawa2011">Gawa2011</a>] looks at the value of having a coach. However feedback is collected, remember that it is meant to be formative: its goal is to help people figure out what they are doing well and what they still need to work on. Please also remember that these guidelines are for peer-to-peer feedback on your lesson delivery; gathering feedback from your learners should be as close to continuous as you can make it, and you should prompt for questions and reflections as well as positives and negatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Studio Classes</strong></p>
<p>Architecture schools often include studio classes, in which students solve small design problems and get feedback from their peers right then and there. These classes are most effective when the teacher critiques both the designs and the peer critiques, so that participants learn not only how to make buildings, but how to give and get feedback [<a href="./bib.html#Scho1984">Scho1984</a>]. Master classes in music serve a similar purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tells</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has nervous habits. For example, many of us talk more rapidly and in a higher-pitched voice than usual, while others play with their hair or crack their knuckles. Gamblers call nervous habits like this “tells”. While these are often not as noticeable as you would think, it’s good to know whether you pace, fiddle with your hair, look at your shoes, or rattle the change in your pocket when you don’t know the answer to a question.</p>
<p>You can’t get rid of tells completely, and trying to do so can make you obsess about them. A better strategy is to try to displace them, e.g., to train yourself to scrunch your toes inside your shoes instead of cracking your knuckles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="s:performance-practice">8.3) How to Practice Performance</h2>
<p>The best way to improve your in-person lesson delivery is to watch yourself do it. This method is borrowed from Warren Code at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<ol>
<li>Work in groups of three.</li>
<li>Each person rotates through the roles of teacher, audience, and videographer. The teacher has two minutes to explain one key idea from their teaching or other work as if they were talking to a class of high school students. The person pretending to be the audience is there to be attentive, while the videographer records the session using a cellphone or other handheld device.</li>
<li>After everyone has finished teaching, the whole group watches the videos together. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e., people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.</li>
<li>After the videos have been discussed, they are deleted. (Many people are increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of images of themselves appearing online.)</li>
<li>Finally, return to the main group and add the feedback to a shared <span class="math inline">2 × 2</span> grid that separates positive from negative and content from presentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for this exercise to work well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record all three videos and then watch all three. If the cycle is teach-review-teach-review, the last person to teach runs out of time. Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching also helps put a bit of distance between the teaching and the reviewing, which makes the exercise slightly less excruciating.</li>
<li>Let people know at the start of the class that they will be asked to teach something so that they have time to choose a topic. (Telling them this in advance can be counter-productive, since some people will fret over how much they should prepare.)</li>
<li>Groups must be physically separated to reduce audio cross-talk between their recordings. In practice, this means 2–3 groups in a normal-sized classroom, with the rest using nearby breakout spaces, coffee lounges, offices, or (on one occasion) a janitor’s storage closet.</li>
<li>People must give feedback on themselves, as well as giving feedback on each other, so that they can calibrate their impressions of their own teaching according to the impressions of other people. (Most people are harder on themselves than others are, and it’s important for them to realize this.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The announcement of this exercise is often greeted with groans and apprehension, since few people enjoy seeing or hearing themselves. However, those same people consistently rate it as one of the most valuable parts of workshops based on these notes. It’s also good preparation for co-teaching (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-together">Section 9.3</a>): teachers find it a lot easier to give each other informal feedback if they have had some practice doing so and have a shared rubric to set expectations.</p>
<h2 id="s:performance-live">8.4) Live Coding</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Teaching is theater, not cinema.<br />
— Neal Davis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One technique that completely changed the way I teach programming is <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:live-coding"><strong>live coding</strong></a>. Instead of using slides, teachers actually write code in front of their class as their learners follow along. It’s more effective than slides for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same code.</li>
<li>It enables teachers to be more responsive to “what if?” questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, live coding allows teachers to go off road and follow their learners’ interests.</li>
<li>It facilitates lateral knowledge transfer: people learn more than we realized we were teaching by watching <em>how</em> teachers do things.</li>
<li>It slows the teacher down: if she has to type in the program as she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners, rather than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.</li>
<li>It helps to keep the load on short-term memory down because it makes the teacher more aware of how much they are throwing at their learners. (This isn’t true of slides or of copy-and-paste.)</li>
<li>Learners get to see teachers’ mistakes <em>and how to diagnose and correct them</em>. Novices are going to spend most of their time doing this, but it’s left out of most textbooks.</li>
<li>Watching teachers make mistakes shows learners that it’s all right to make mistakes of their own. Most people model the behavior of their teachers: if the teacher isn’t embarrassed about making and talking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers need a bit of practice to get comfortable with thinking aloud as they code in front of an audience, but most report that it is then no more difficult than talking around a deck of slides, and research seems to back up its effectiveness [<a href="./bib.html#Rubi2013">Rubi2013</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Haar2017">Haar2017</a>]. The sections below offer tips on how to make your live coding better.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-your-mistakes" class="unnumbered">Embrace Your Mistakes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The typos are the pedagogy.<br />
— Emily Jane McTavish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important rule of live coding is to embrace your mistakes. No matter how well you prepare, you will make some; when you do, think through them with your audience. While data is hard to come by, professional programmers spend anywhere from 25% to 60% of their time debugging; novices spend much more (<a href="./pck.html#s:pck-debug">Section 7.2</a>), but most textbooks and tutorials spend little time diagnosing and correct problems. If you talk aloud while you figure out what you mistyped or where you took the wrong path, and explain how you’ve corrected yourself, you will give your learners a toolbox they can use when they make their own mistakes.</p>
<p>This is at odds with advice like that in [<a href="./bib.html#Kran2015">Kran2015</a>], which says, “<span>…</span>you should have your material <em>absolutely mastered</em> before you enter the classroom. If<span>…</span>you have a proof or example that is not quite right<span>…</span>and stand in front of the group trying to fix it, then you will lose all but the diehards quickly.” In contrast, the feedback we’ve had in <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> workshops and other settings is that watching the teacher make mistakes actually motivates most students, since it gives them permission to be less than perfect as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deliberate Fumbles</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve given a lesson several times, you’re unlikely to make anything other than basic typing mistakes (which can still be informative). You can try to remember past mistakes and make them deliberately, but that often feels forced (unless the mistake and how to correct it is the primary purpose of the lesson). A better approach is sometimes called <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:twitch-coding"><strong>twitch coding</strong></a>: ask learners one by one to tell you what to type next. This is pretty much guaranteed to get you into the weeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ask-for-predictions" class="unnumbered">Ask For Predictions</h3>
<p>One way to keep students engaged while you are live coding is to ask them to make predictions, e.g., to say, “What is going to happen when I run this code?” You can then either show them, or write down the first few suggestions they make, have the whole class vote on which they think is most likely, and then run the code. As well as keeping their attention on task, this gives them practice at reasoning about code’s behavior, which is a useful skill in its own right.</p>
<h3 id="take-it-slow" class="unnumbered">Take It Slow</h3>
<p>For every command you type, every word of code you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud what you are doing while you do it, then point to the command and its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This not only slows you down, it allows learners who are following along to copy what you do, or to catch up, even when they are looking at their screen while doing it. Whatever you do, <em>don’t</em> copy and paste code: doing this practically guarantees that you’ll race ahead of your learners. And if you use tab completion, say it out loud the first few times so that your learners understand what you’re doing: “Let’s use turtle dot ’r’ ’i’ and tab to get ’right’.”</p>
<p>If the output of your command or code makes what you just typed disappear from view, scroll back up so learners can see it again. If that’s not practical, execute the same command a second time, or copy and paste the last command(s) into the workshop’s shared notes.</p>
<h3 id="be-seen-and-heard" class="unnumbered">Be Seen and Heard</h3>
<p>If you are physically able to stand up for a couple of hours, do it while you are teaching. When you sit down, you are hiding yourself behind others for those sitting in the back rows. Make sure to notify the workshop organizers of your wish to stand up and ask them to arrange a high table, standing desk, or lectern.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you are standing or sitting, make sure to move around as much as reasonable. You can for example go to the screen to point something out, or draw something on the white/blackboard (see below). Moving around makes the teaching more lively, less monotonous. It draws the learners’ attention away from their screens, to you, which helps get the point you are making across.</p>
<p>Even though you may have a good voice and know how to use it well, it may be a good idea to use a microphone, especially if the workshop room is equipped with one. Your voice will be less tired, and you increase the chance of people with hearing difficulties being able to follow the workshop.</p>
<h3 id="mirror-your-learners-environment" class="unnumbered">Mirror Your Learner’s Environment</h3>
<p>You may have customized your environment with a fancy Unix shell prompt, a custom color scheme for your development environment, or a plethora of keyboard shortcuts. Your learners won’t have any of this, so try to create an environment that mirrors what they <em>do</em> have. Some teachers create a separate bare-bones user (login) account on their laptop, or a separate teaching-only account if they’re using an online service like Scratch or GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="use-the-screen-wisely" class="unnumbered">Use the Screen Wisely</h3>
<p>You will need to enlarge your font considerably in order for people to read it from the back of the room, which means you can put much less on the screen than you’re used to. You will often be reduced to 60–70 columns and 20–30 rows, which basically means that you’re using a 21st Century supercomputer to emulate an early-1980s VT100 terminal.</p>
<p>To cope with this, maximize your window, and then ask everyone to give you a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on its readability. Use a black font on a lightly-tinted background rather than a light font on a dark background—the light tint will glare less than a pure white background.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the room lighting as well: it should not be fully dark, and there should be no lights directly on or above the presenter’s screen. If needed, reposition the tables so all learners can see the screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Accessibility Aids Help Everyone</strong></p>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://boinx.com/mousepose/overview/">Mouseposé</a> (for Mac) and <a href="http://www.pointerfocus.com/">PointerFocus</a> (for Windows) will highlight the position of your mouse cursor on the screen, and screen recording software tools like <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html">Camtasia</a> will echo invisible keys like tab and Control-J as you type them. These take a bit of practice to get used to, but are extremely helpful as you start teaching more advanced tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the bottom of the projector screen is at the same height, or below, the heads of the learners, people in the back won’t be able to see the lower parts. Raise the bottom of your window(s) to compensate, but be aware that this gives you even less space for your typing.</p>
<p>If you can get a second projector and screen, use it: the extra real estate will allow you to display your code on one side and its output or behavior on the other. The second screen may require its own PC or laptop, so you may need to ask a helper to control it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Multiple Personalities</strong></p>
<p>If you teach using a console window, such as a Unix shell, it’s important to tell people when you run an in-console text editor and when you return to the console prompt. Most novices have never seen a window take on multiple personalities in this way, and can quickly become confused (particularly if the window is hosting an interactive interpreter prompt for Python or some other language as well as running shell commands and hosting an editor).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="double-devices" class="unnumbered">Double Devices</h3>
<p>Some people now use two devices when teaching: a laptop plugged into the projector for learners to see, and a tablet beside it so that they can view their own notes and the shared notes that the learners are taking together (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-notetaking">Section 9.7</a>). This is more reliable than displaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another. Of course, printouts of the lesson material are still the most reliable backup technology<span>…</span></p>
<h3 id="use-diagrams" class="unnumbered">Use Diagrams</h3>
<p>Diagrams are almost always a good idea. Creating them in advance to bring up on screen is a common practice—I often have a slide deck full of diagrams in the background when I’m doing live coding—but don’t underestimate the value of sketching on the whiteboard as you go through your lesson. This allows you to build diagrams step by step, which helps with retention (<a href="./load.html#s:load-split-attention">Section 4.1</a>) and allows you to improvise.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-distractions" class="unnumbered">Avoid Distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off any notifications you may use on your laptop, such as those from social media, email, etc. Seeing notifications flash by on the screen distracts you as well as the learners, and it can be awkward when a message pops up you’d rather not have others see. If you are teaching frequently, you might want to create a second account on your computer that doesn’t have email or other tools set up at all.</p>
<h3 id="improvise-after-you-know-the-material" class="unnumbered">Improvise After You Know the Material</h3>
<p>The first time you teach a new lesson, stick fairly closely to the lesson plan you’ve drawn up or borrowed. It may be tempting to deviate from the material because you would like to show a neat trick or demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Resist: there is a fair chance you’ll run into something unexpected that you then have to explain.</p>
<p>Once you are more familiar with the material, though, you can and should start improvising based on the backgrounds of your learners, their questions in class, and what you find most interesting about the lesson. This is like playing a new song: the first few times, you stick to the sheet music, but after you’re comfortable with it, you can start to put your own stamp on it.</p>
<p>If you really want to use something outside of the material, run through it beforehand as you plan to in class <em>using the same computer that you’ll be teaching on</em>. Installing several hundred megabytes of software updates over high school WiFi in front of increasingly bored 16-year-olds isn’t something you want to do twice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Direct Instruction</strong></p>
<p><a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:direct-instruction"><strong>Direct Instruction</strong></a> is a teaching method centered around meticulous curriculum design delivered through a prescribed script—i.e., it’s more like an actor reciting lines than it is like the improvisatory approach we recommend. [<a href="./bib.html#Stoc2018">Stoc2018</a>] surveys studies and finds statistically significant positive effect, even though DI sometimes gets knocked for being mechanical. We still prefer improvisation because DI requires a far greater up-front investment than most free-range learning groups can afford.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="face-the-screenoccasionally" class="unnumbered">Face the Screen—Occasionally</h3>
<p>It’s OK to face the screen occasionally, particularly when you are walking through a section of code statement by statement or drawing a diagram, but you shouldn’t do this for more than a few seconds at a time. Looking at the screen for a few seconds can help lower your anxiety levels, since it gives you a brief break from being looked at.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to treat the screen as one of your learners: if it would be uncomfortable to stare at someone for as long as you are spending looking at the screen, it’s time to turn around and face your audience.</p>
<h3 id="drawbacks" class="unnumbered">Drawbacks</h3>
<p>Live coding does have some drawbacks, but with practice, these can be avoided or worked around. A common one is going too slowly, either because you are not a good typist or because you are spending too much time looking at notes trying to figure out what to type next. The fix for the first is a bit of typing practice; the fix for the second is to break the lesson into very short pieces, so that you only ever have to remember one small step to take next.</p>
<p>A deeper exercise is that typing in library import statements, class headers, and other boilerplate code increases the extraneous cognitive load on your learners (<a href="./load.html">Chapter 4</a>). If you spend a lot of time doing this, it may be all that learners take away, so give yourself and your learners skeleton code to start with (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-blank">Section 9.9</a>).</p>

<h3 id="give-feedback-on-bad-teaching-whole-class20-minutes" class="unnumbered">Give Feedback on Bad Teaching (<span>whole class</span>/<span>20</span> minutes)</h3>

<li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U">this video of bad teaching</a> as a group and give feedback on it. Organize feedback along two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation.</li>
<li>Have each person in the class add one point to a <span class="math inline">2 × 2</span> grid on a whiteboard (or in the shared notes) without duplicating any points that are already up there.</li>
</ol>
<p>What did other people see that you missed? What did they think that you strongly agree or disagree with?</p>

<p>Use the process described above to practice teaching in groups of three. When your group is done, the teacher will add one point of feedback from each participant to a <span class="math inline">2 × 2</span> grid on the whiteboard or in the shared notes, without accepting duplicates. Participants should not say whether the point they offer was made by them, about them, or neither: the goal at this stage is primarily for people to become comfortable with giving and receiving feedback, and to establish a consensus about what sorts of things to look for.</p>

<p>Watch the videos of <a href="https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE">live coding done poorly</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY">live coding done well</a> and summarize your feedback on both using the usual <span class="math inline">2 × 2</span> grid. These videos assume learners know what a shell variable is, know how to use the <code>head</code> command, and are familiar with the contents of the data files being filtered.</p>

<p>Teach 3–4 minutes of a lesson using live coding to a fellow trainee, then swap and watch while that person live codes for you. Don’t bother trying to record the live coding sessions—we have found that it’s difficult to capture both the person and the screen with a handheld device—but give feedback the same way you have previously (positive and negative, content and presentation). Explain in advance to your fellow trainee what you will be teaching and what the learners you teach it to are expected to be familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>What felt different about live coding (versus standing up and lecturing)? What was harder/easier?</li>
<li>Did you make any mistakes? If so, how did you handle them?</li>
<li>Did you talk and type at the same time, or alternate?</li>
<li>How often did you point at the screen? How often did you highlight with the mouse?</li>
<li>What will you try to do differently next time?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Read the description of tells at the end of <a href="./performance.html#s:performance-feedback">Section 8.2</a>, then make a note of what you think your tells are, but do not share them with other people.</li>
<li>Teach a short (3–5 minute) lesson.</li>
<li>Ask your audience how they think you betray nervousness. Is their list the same as yours?</li>

<p>The <a href="http://csteachingtips.org/">CS Teaching Tips</a> site has a large number of practical tips on teaching computing, as well as a collection of downloadable tip sheets. In small groups, go through the tip sheets on their home page and classify each tip as “use all the time”, “use occasionally”, “never use”. Where do your practice and your peers’ practice differ? Are there any tips you strongly disagree with, or think would be ineffective?</p>
