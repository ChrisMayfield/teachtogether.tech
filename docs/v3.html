<h1 id="s:v3">M) Design Notes</h1>
<p>This design follows the backward design process described in <a href="./process.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="brainstorming" class="unnumbered">Brainstorming</h2>
<p><em>These questions and answers provide a rough scope for the material.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>What problems will learners learn how to solve?
<ol>
<li>How people learn and what that tells us about how best to teach them (educational psychology, cognitive load, study skills).</li>
<li>How to design and deliver instruction in computing skills (backward curriculum design, some pedagogical content knowledge for computing).</li>
<li>How to deliver lessons (teaching as a performance art, live coding, motivation and demotivation, and automation).</li>
<li>How to grow a teaching community (community organization and marketing).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What is out of scope?
<ol>
<li>How to teach children or people with special learning needs. Much of what’s in this material applies to those learners, but they have different or extra needs.</li>
<li>How to rigorously assess the impact of training. Informal self-assessment will be included, but we will not try to explain how to do publishable scientific research in education.</li>
<li>How to design and deliver entire degree programs and other extended curriculum. Again, much of what’s in this material applies, but the extra needs of large-scale curriculum design is out of scope.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What concepts and techniques will learners encounter?
<ol>
<li><span class="math inline">7 ± 2</span> and chunking.</li>

<li>Working memory vs. persistent memory.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What mistakes or misconceptions will they have?
<ol>
<li>Children and adults learn the same way.</li>
<li>Computing education should be for and about computer science.</li>
<li>Programming skill is innate.</li>
<li>Student evaluations of courses are indicative of learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Teaching ability is innate.</li>
<li>The best way to teach is to throw people in at the deep end.</li>
<li>The best way to teach is to use “real” tools right from the start.</li>
<li>Visual-auditory-kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles are real.</li>
<li>Women just don’t like programming or innately have less aptitude.</li>
<li>Getting a (better) job is the main reason someone should learn how to program.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In what contexts will this material be used?
<ol>
<li>Primary: an intensive weekend workshop for people in tech who want to volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding initiatives.</li>
<li>Secondary: self-study or guided study by such people.</li>
<li>Secondary: a one-semester undergraduate course for computer science majors interested in education.</li>

<h2 id="intended-audience" class="unnumbered">Intended Audience</h2>
<p><em>These learner personas clarify what readers are interested in and what can be assumed about their prior knowledge.</em></p>
<dl>
<dt>Emily</dt>
<dd><p>trained as a librarian, and now works as a web designer and project manager in a small consulting company. In her spare time, she helps run web design classes for women entering tech as a second career. She is now recruiting colleagues to run more classes in her area using the lessons that she has created, and wants to know how to grow a volunteer teaching organization.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Moshe</dt>
<dd><p>is a professional programmer with two teenage children whose school doesn’t offer programming classes. He has volunteered to run a monthly after-school programming club, and while he frequently gives presentations to colleagues, he has no experience designing lessons. He wants to learn how to build effective lessons in collaboration with others, and is interested in turning his lessons into a self-paced online course.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Samira</dt>
<dd><p>is an undergraduate in robotics who is thinking about becoming a full-time teacher after she graduates. She wants to help teach weekend workshops for undergraduate women, but has never taught an entire class before, and feels uncomfortable teaching things that she’s not an expert in. She wants to learn more about education in general in order to decide if it’s for her.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gene</dt>
<dd><p>is a professor of computer science whose research area is operating systems. They have been teaching undergraduate classes for six years, and increasingly believe that there has to be a better way. The only training available through their university’s teaching and learning center relates to posting assignments and grades in the learning management system, so they want to find out what else they ought to be asking for.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A variety of technical backgrounds and skills.</li>
<li>May or may not have some teaching experience.</li>
<li>No formal training in teaching, lesson design, or community organization.</li>
<li>More likely to teach in free-range settings often than in institutional classrooms with required homework, final exams, and externally-mandated curriculum.</li>
<li>Focused on teenagers and adults rather children.</li>
<li>Limited time and resources (either because they are volunteers, or because their institution considers teaching a secondary responsibility).</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning contexts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Emily</dt>
<dd><p>will take part in a weekly online reading group with her volunteers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Moshe</dt>
<dd><p>will cover part of this book in a two-day weekend workshop and study the rest on his own.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Samira</dt>
<dd><p>will use this book in a one-semester undergraduate course with assignments, a project, and a final exam.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gene</dt>
<dd><p>will read the book on their own in their office or while commuting, wishing all the while that universities did more to support high-quality teaching.</p>
</dd>

<h2 id="course-overview" class="unnumbered">Course Overview</h2>
<h3 id="brief-description" class="unnumbered">Brief Description</h3>
<p>Teaching isn’t magic: good teachers are simply people who have learned how to design lessons to achieve concrete goals, how to get and use feedback from learners, and how to work well with other teachers. This book will show you how to do these things and more, and will introduce you to some of the research that explains why some things work and some things don’t. It is primarily intended for people in tech with no formal training in teaching who want to help adults learn how to create web sites, write programs, and analyze data, but the ideas apply equally well to other groups in other settings.</p>
<h3 id="learning-objectives" class="unnumbered">Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Learners will be able to<span>…</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the cognitive changes that occur as people go from novice to competent to expert and how best to teach each group.</li>
<li>Explain how to design, construct, and maintain lessons in a systematic, collaborative way.</li>
<li>Design exercises to help correct key misconceptions that learners have about computing.</li>
<li>Summarize key elements of pedagogical content knowledge related to computing and other technical skills.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast teaching with other performance arts and participate in structured critiques of live teaching.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast interactive teaching, automated teaching, and hybrid models.</li>
<li>Describe factors that motivate or demotivate adult learners and how to take those into account when teaching.</li>
<li>Describe ways in which members of different groups are made to feel unwelcome or excluded in computing and what can be done to make computing more inclusive.</li>
<li>Explain the purpose and value of their teaching and of their community of practice.</li>
<li>Be a productive member of a community of teaching practice.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prerequisites" class="unnumbered">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Some exercises will assume a small amount of programming knowledge: readers should know how to loop over the elements of a list, how to take action using an if-else statement, and how to write and call a simple function.</p>
