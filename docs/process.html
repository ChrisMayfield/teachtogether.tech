<h1 id="s:process">6) A Lesson Design Process</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>After reading this chapter, you will be able to<span>…</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the steps in backward lesson design and explain why it generally produces better lessons than the more common forward development process.</li>
<li>Define “teaching to the test” and explain why backward lesson design is <em>not</em> the same thing.</li>
<li>Construct and critique five-part learner personas.</li>
<li>Construct good learning objectives and critique learning objectives with reference to Bloom’s Taxonomy and/or Fink’s Taxonomy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people design lessons like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone asks you to teach something you haven’t thought about in years.</li>
<li>You start writing slides to explain what you know about the subject.</li>
<li>After two or three weeks, you make up an assignment based more or less on what you’ve taught so far.</li>
<li>You repeat step 3 several times.</li>
<li>You stay awake into the wee hours of the morning to create a final exam and promise yourself that you’ll be more organized next time.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a better way, but to explain it, we first need to explain how <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:test-driven-development"><strong>test-driven development</strong></a> (TDD) is used in software development. Programmers who are using TDD don’t write software and then write tests to check that the software is doing the write thing. Instead, they write the tests first, then write just enough new software to make those tests pass, and then clean up a bit.</p>
<p>TDD works because writing tests forces programmers to specify exactly what they’re trying to accomplish and what “done” looks like. It’s easy to be vague when using a human language like English or Korean; it’s much harder to be vague in Python or R. TDD also reduces the risk of endless polishing, and the risk of confirmation bias: someone who hasn’t written a program is much more likely to be objective when testing it than its original author, and someone who hasn’t written a program <em>yet</em> is more likely to test it objectively than someone who has just put in several hours of hard work and really, really wants to be done.</p>
<p>A similar backward method works very well for lesson design. This method is something called <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:backward-design"><strong>backward design</strong></a>; developed independently in [<a href="./bib.html#Wigg2005">Wigg2005</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Bigg2011">Bigg2011</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Fink2013">Fink2013</a>], it is summarized in [<a href="./bib.html#McTi2013">McTi2013</a>], and in simplified form, its steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brainstorm to get a rough idea of what you want to cover, how you’re going to do it, what problems or misconceptions you expect to encounter, what’s <em>not</em> going to be included, and so on. You may also want to draw some concept maps at this stage.</li>
<li>Create or recycle learner personas (discussed in the next section) to figure out who you are trying to teach and what will appeal to them. (This step can also be done first, before the brainstorming.)</li>
<li>Create formative assessments that will give the learners a chance to practice the things they’re trying to learn and tell you and them whether they’re making progress and where they need to focus their work.</li>
<li>Put the formative assessments in order based on their complexity and dependencies to create a course outline.</li>
<li>Write just enough to get learners from one formative assessment to the next. Each hour in the classroom will then consist of three or four such episodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>This method helps to keep teaching focused on its objectives. It also ensures that learners don’t face anything on the final exam that the course hasn’t prepared them for. It is <em>not</em> the same thing as “teaching to the test”. When using backward design, teachers set goals to aid in lesson design, and may never actually give the final exam that they wrote. In many school systems, on the other hand, an external authority defines assessment criteria for all learners, regardless of their individual situations. The outcomes of those summative assessments directly affect the teachers’ pay and promotion, which means teachers have an incentive to focus on having learners pass test rather than on helping them learn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Measure<span>…</span>And Then?</strong></p>
<p>[<a href="./bib.html#Gree2014">Gree2014</a>] argues that this focus on measurement is appealing to those with the power to set the tests, but unlikely to improve outcomes unless it is coupled with support for teachers to make improvements based on test outcomes. The latter is often missing because large organizations usually value uniformity over productivity [<a href="./bib.html#Scot1998">Scot1998</a>]; we will return to this topic in <a href="./performance.html">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that while lesson design is <em>described</em> as a sequence, it’s almost never <em>done</em> that way: we may, for example, change our mind about what we want to teach based on something that occurs to us while we’re writing an MCQ, or re-assess who we’re trying to help once we have a lesson outline. However, it’s important that the notes we leave behind to present things in the order described above, because that’s the easier way for whoever has to use or maintain the lesson to retrace our thinking. The same rewriting of history is useful for the same reasons in software design and many other fields [<a href="./bib.html#Parn1986">Parn1986</a>].</p>
<p><a href="./v3.html">Appendix M</a> presents the design notes for this version of this book. A few things have been added, dropped, or rearranged, but what you are reading now matches the plan pretty closely.</p>
<h2 id="s:process-personas">6.1) Learner Personas</h2>
<p>A key step in the lesson design process described above is figuring out who your audience is. One way to do this is to write two or three <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:learner-persona"><strong>learner personas</strong></a>. This technique is borrowed from user interface designers, who create short profiles of typical users to help them think about their audience.</p>
<p>Learner personas have five parts: the person’s general background, what they already know, what <em>they</em> think they want to do (as opposed to what someone who already understands the subject thinks), how the course will help them, and any special needs they might have. The personas in <a href="./intro.html#s:intro-audience">Section 1.1</a> have the five points listed above, rearranged to flow more readably; a learner persona for a weekend workshop aimed at college students might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jorge has just moved from Costa Rica to Canada to study agricultural engineering. He has joined the college soccer team, and is looking forward to learning how to play ice hockey.</li>
<li>Other than using Excel, Word, and the Internet, Jorge’s most significant previous experience with computers is helping his sister build a WordPress site for the family business back home in Costa Rica.</li>
<li>Jorge needs to measure properties of soil from nearby farms using a handheld device that sends logs in a text format to his computer. Right now, Jorge has to open each file in Excel, crop the first and last points, and calculate an average.</li>
<li>This workshop will show Jorge how to write a little Python program to read the data, select the right values from each file, and calculate the required statistics.</li>
<li>Jorge can read English well, but still struggles sometimes to keep up with spoken conversation (especially if it involves a lot of new jargon).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Gentle Reminder</strong></p>
<p>When designing lessons, you must always remember that <em>you are not your learners</em>. You may be younger (if you’re teaching seniors) or wealthier (and therefore able to afford to download videos without foregoing a meal to pay for the bandwidth), but you are almost certainly more knowledgeable about technology. Don’t assume that you know what they need or will understand: ask them, and pay attention to their answer. After all, it’s only fair that learning should go both ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than writing new personas for every lesson or course, it’s common for teachers to create and share a handful that cover everyone they are likely to teach, then pick a few from that set to describe who particular material is intended for. When personas are used this way, they become a convenient shorthand for design issues: when speaking with each other, teachers can say, “Would Jorge understand why we’re doing this?” or, “What installation problems would Jorge face?”</p>
<p>Brainstorming the broad outlines of what you’re going to teach and then deciding who you’re trying to help is one approach; it’s equally valid to pick an audience and then brainstorm their needs. Either way, [<a href="./bib.html#Guzd2016">Guzd2016</a>] offers the following guidance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to what learners know.</li>
<li>Keep cognitive load low.</li>
<li>Use authentic tasks (see <a href="./motivation.html#s:motivation-authentic">Section 10.1</a>).</li>
<li>Be generative and productive.</li>
<li>Test your ideas rather than trusting your instincts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, one size won’t fit all. [<a href="./bib.html#Alha2018">Alha2018</a>] reported improvement in learning outcomes and student satisfaction in a course for students from a variety of academic backgrounds which allowed them to choose between different domain-related assignments. It’s extra work to set up and grade, but that’s manageable if the projects are open-ended (so that they can be used repeatedly) and if the load is shared with other teachers (<a href="./process.html#s:process-maintainability">Section 6.3</a>). Other work has shown that building courses for science students around topics as diverse as music, data science, and cell biology will also improve outcomes [<a href="./bib.html#Pete2017">Pete2017</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Dahl2018">Dahl2018</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Ritz2018">Ritz2018</a>].</p>
<h2 id="s:process-objectives">6.2) Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Formative and summative assessments help teachers figure out what they’re going to teach, but in order to communicate that to learners and other teachers, a course description should also have <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:learning-objective"><strong>learning objectives</strong></a>. These help ensure that everyone has the same understanding of what a lesson is supposed to accomplish. For example, a statement like “understand Git” could mean any of the following, each of which would be backed by a very different lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learners can describe three scenarios in which version control systems like Git are better than file-sharing tools like Dropbox, and two in which they are worse.</li>
<li>Learners can commit a changed file to a Git repository using a desktop GUI tool.</li>
<li>Learners can explain what a detached HEAD is and recover from it using command-line operations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Objectives vs. Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>A learning objective is what a lesson strives to achieve. A <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:learning-outcome"><strong>learning outcome</strong></a> is what it actually achieves, i.e., what learners actually take away. The role of summative assessment is therefore to compare learning outcomes with learning objectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A learning objective is a single sentence describing how a learner will demonstrate what they have learned once they have successfully completed a lesson. More specifically, it has a <em>measurable or verifiable verb</em> that states what the learner will do, and specifies the <em>criteria for acceptable performance</em>. Writing these kinds of learning objectives may initially seem restrictive or limiting, but will make you, your fellow teachers, and your learners happier in the long run. You will end up with clear guidelines for both your teaching and assessment, and your learners will appreciate the clear expectations.</p>
<p>One way to understand what makes for a good learning objective is to see how a poor one can be improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The learner will be given opportunities to learn good programming practices.” This describes the lesson’s content, not the attributes of successful students.</li>
<li>“The learner will have a better appreciation for good programming practices.” This doesn’t start with an active verb or define the level of learning, and the subject of learning has no context and is not specific.</li>
<li>“The learner will understand how to program in R.” While this starts with an active verb, it doesn’t define the level of learning, and the subject of learning is still too vague for assessment.</li>
<li>“The learner will write one-page data analysis scripts to read, filter, summarize, and print results for tabular data using R and R Studio.” This starts with an active verb, defines the level of learning, and provides context to ensure that outcomes can be assessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to choosing verbs, many teachers use <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:blooms-taxonomy"><strong>Bloom’s taxonomy</strong></a>. First published in 1956, it was updated at the turn of the century [<a href="./bib.html#Ande2001">Ande2001</a>], and is the most widely used framework for discussing levels of understanding. Its most recent form has six categories; the list below defines each, and gives a few of the verbs typically used in learning objectives written for each:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Remembering:</dt>
<dd><p>Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers. <em>(recognize, list, describe, name, find)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Understanding:</dt>
<dd><p>Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main ideas. <em>(interpret, summarize, paraphrase, classify, explain)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Applying:</dt>
<dd><p>Solve new problems by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules in a different way. <em>(build, identify, use, plan, select)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Analyzing:</dt>
<dd><p>Examine and break information into parts by identifying motives or causes. Make inferences and find evidence to support generalizations. <em>(compare, contrast, simplify)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Evaluating:</dt>
<dd><p>Present and defend opinions by making judgments about information, validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. <em>(check, choose, critique, prove, rate)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Creating:</dt>
<dd><p>Compile information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions. <em>(design, construct, improve, adapt, maximize, solve)</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>[<a href="./bib.html#Masa2018">Masa2018</a>] found that even experienced educators have trouble agreeing on how to classify a question or idea according to Bloom’s Taxonomy, but the material in most introductory programming courses fits into the first four of these levels; only once that material has been mastered can learners start to think about evaluating and creating. (As Daniel Willingham has said, people can’t think without something to think about [<a href="./bib.html#Will2010">Will2010</a>].)</p>
<p>Another way to think about learning objectives comes from [<a href="./bib.html#Fink2013">Fink2013</a>], which defines learning in terms of the change it is meant to produce in the learner. <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:finks-taxonomy"><strong>Fink’s Taxonomy</strong></a> also has six categories, but unlike Bloom’s, they are complementary rather than hierarchical:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Foundational Knowledge:</dt>
<dd><p>understanding and remembering information and ideas. <em>(remember, understand, identify)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Application:</dt>
<dd><p>skills, critical thinking, managing projects. <em>(use, solve, calculate, create)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Integration:</dt>
<dd><p>connecting ideas, learning experiences, and real life. <em>(connect, relate, compare)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Human Dimension:</dt>
<dd><p>learning about oneself and others. <em>(come to see themselves as, understand others in terms of, decide to become)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Caring:</dt>
<dd><p>developing new feelings, interests, and values. <em>(get excited about, be ready to, value)</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Learning How to Learn:</dt>
<dd><p>becoming a better student. <em>(identify source of information for, frame useful questions about)</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A set of learning objectives based on this taxonomy for an introductory course on HTML and CSS might be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the end of this course, learners will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the difference between markup and presentation, what CSS properties are, and how CSS selectors work.</li>
<li>Write and style a web page using common tags and CSS properties.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast authoring with HTML and CSS to authoring with desktop publishing tools.</li>
<li>Identify issues in sample web pages that would make them difficult for the visually impaired to interact with and provide appropriate corrections.</li>
<li>Explain the role that JavaScript plays in styling web pages and want to learn more about how to use it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="s:process-maintainability">6.3) Maintainability</h2>
<p>It takes a lot of effort to create a good lesson, but once it has been built, someone needs to maintain it, and doing that is a lot easier if it has been built in a maintainable way. But what exactly does “maintainable” mean? The short answer is that a lesson is maintainable if it’s cheaper to update it than to replace it. This equation depends on three factors. The first is <em>how well documented the course’s design is.</em> If the person doing maintenance doesn’t know (or doesn’t remember) what the lesson is supposed to accomplish or why topics are introduced in a particular order, it will take her more time to update it. One of the reasons to use the design process described earlier in this chapter is to capture decisions about why each course is the way it is.</p>
<p>The second factor is <em>how easy it is for collaborators to collaborate technically.</em> Teachers usually share material by mailing PowerPoint files to each other or putting them in a shared drive. Collaborative writing tools like <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> and wikis are a big improvement, as they allow many people to update the same document and comment on other people’s updates. The version control systems used by programmers, such as <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, are another big advance, since they let any number of people work independently and then merge their changes back together in a controlled, reviewable way. Unfortunately, version control systems have a long, steep learning curve, and (still) don’t handle common office document formats.</p>
<p>The third factor, which is the most important in practice, is <em>how willing people are to collaborate.</em> The tools needed to build a “Wikipedia for lessons” have been around for twenty years, but most teachers still don’t write and share lessons the way that they write and share encyclopedia entries, even though commons-based lesson development and maintenance actually works very well (<a href="./community.html#s:community-governance">Section 13.4</a> and <a href="./joining.html#s:joining-contributing">Section C.3</a>).</p>
<p>[<a href="./bib.html#Leak2017">Leak2017</a>] interviewed 17 computer science teachers to find out why they don’t use resource sharing sites. They found that most of the reasons were operational. For example, respondents said that sites need good landing pages that ask “what is your current role?” and “what course and grade level are you interested in?”, and should display all their resources in context, since visitors may be new teachers who are struggling to connect the dots themselves. They also said that sites should allow anonymous posts on discussion forums to reduce fear of looking foolish in front of peers.</p>
<p>One interesting observation is that while teachers don’t collaborate at scale, they <em>do</em> remix by finding other people’s materials online or in textbooks and reworking them. That suggests that the root problem may be a flawed analogy: rather than lesson development being like writing a Wikipedia article or some open source software, perhaps it’s more like sampling in music.</p>
<p>If this is true, then lessons may be the wrong granularity for sharing, and collaboration might be more likely to take hold if the thing being collaborated on was smaller. This fits well with Caulfield’s theory of <a href="https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/">choral explanations</a>. He argues that sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> succeed because they provide a chorus of answers for every question, each of which is most suitable for a slightly different questioner. If Caulfield is right, the lessons of tomorrow may include guided tours of community-curated Q&amp;A repositories designed to accommodate learners at widely different levels.</p>
<h2 id="s:process-exercises">6.4) Exercises</h2>
<h3 id="create-learner-personas-small-groups30-minutes" class="unnumbered">Create Learner Personas (<span>small groups</span>/<span>30</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>Working in small groups, create a five-point persona that describes one of your typical learners.</p>
<h3 id="classify-learning-objectives-pairs10-minutes" class="unnumbered">Classify Learning Objectives (<span>pairs</span>/<span>10</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>Look at the example learning objectives given for an introductory course on HTML and CSS in <a href="./process.html#s:process-objectives">Section 6.2</a> and classify each according to Bloom’s Taxonomy. Compare your answers with those of your partner: where did you agree and disagree, and why?</p>
<h3 id="write-learning-objectives-pairs20-minutes" class="unnumbered">Write Learning Objectives (<span>pairs</span>/<span>20</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>Write one or more learning objectives for something you currently teach or plan to teach using Bloom’s Taxonomy. Working with a partner, critique and improve the objectives.</p>
<h3 id="write-more-learning-objectives-pairs20-minutes" class="unnumbered">Write More Learning Objectives (<span>pairs</span>/<span>20</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>Write one or more learning objectives for something you currently teach or plan to teach using Fink’s Taxonomy. Working with a partner, critique and improve the objectives.</p>
<h3 id="building-lessons-by-subtracting-complexity-individual20-minutes" class="unnumbered">Building Lessons by Subtracting Complexity (<span>individual</span>/<span>20</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>One way to build a programming lesson is to write the program you want learners to finish with, then remove the most complex part that you want them to write and make it the last exercise. You can then remove the next most complex part you want them to write and make it the penultimate exercise, and so on. Anything that’s left—i.e., anything you don’t want them to write as an exercise—becomes the starter code that you give them. This typically includes things like importing libraries and loading data.</p>
<p>Take a program or web page that you want your learners to be able to create on their own at the end of a lesson and work backward to break it into digestible parts. How many are there? What key idea is introduced by each one?</p>
<h3 id="inessential-weirdness-individual15-minutes" class="unnumbered">Inessential Weirdness (<span>individual</span>/<span>15</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>Betsy Leondar-Wright coined the phrase “<a href="http://www.classmatters.org/2006_07/its-not-them.php">inessential weirdness</a>” to describe things groups do that aren’t really necessary, but which alienate people who aren’t members of that group. Sumana Harihareswara later used this notion as the basis for a talk on <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2016/05/21/0">inessential weirdnesses in open source software</a>, which includes things like making disparaging comments about Microsoft Windows, command-line tools with cryptic names, and the command line itself. Take a few minutes to read these articles, then make a list of inessential weirdnesses you think your learners might encounter when you first teach them. How many of these can you avoid with a little effort?</p>
<h3 id="primm-individual15-minutes" class="unnumbered">PRIMM (<span>individual</span>/<span>15</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>One approach to introducing new ideas in computing is <a href="http://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/">PRIMM</a>: <strong>P</strong>redict a program’s behavior or output, <strong>R</strong>un it to see what it actually does, <strong>I</strong>nvestigate why it does that (e.g., by stepping through it in a debugger or drawing the flow of control), <strong>M</strong>odify it (or its inputs), and then <strong>M</strong>ake something similar from scratch. Pick something you have recently taught or been taught and outline a short lesson that follows these five steps.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-lessons-pairs20-minutes" class="unnumbered">Evaluating Lessons (<span>pairs</span>/<span>20</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>[<a href="./bib.html#Mart2017">Mart2017</a>] specifies eight dimensions along which lessons can be evaluated:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Closed vs. open:</dt>
<dd><p>is there a well-defined path and endpoint, or are learners exploring?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cultural relevance:</dt>
<dd><p>how well is the task connected to things they do outside class?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Recognition:</dt>
<dd><p>how easily can the learner share the product of their work?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Space to play:</dt>
<dd><p>seems to overlap closed vs. open</p>
</dd>
<dt>Driver shift:</dt>
<dd><p>how often are learners in control of the learning experience (tight cycles of “see then do” score highly)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Risk reward:</dt>
<dd><p>to what extent is taking risks rewarded or recognized?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Grouping:</dt>
<dd><p>is learning individual, in pairs, or in larger groups?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Session shape:</dt>
<dd><p>theater-style classroom, dinner seating, free space, public space, etc.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Working with a partner, go through a set of lessons you have recently taught, or have recently been taught, and rate them as “low”, “medium”, “high”, or “not applicable” on each of these criteria. Which two criteria are most important to you personally as a teacher? As a learner?</p>
<h3 id="concrete-representational-abstract-pairs15-minutes" class="unnumbered">Concrete-Representational-Abstract (<span>pairs</span>/<span>15</span> minutes)</h3>
<p><a href="https://makingeducationfun.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/concrete-representational-abstract-cra/">Concrete-Representational-Abstract</a> (CRA) is another approach to introducing new ideas that is used primarily with younger learners. The first step is the concrete stage, and involves physically manipulating objects to solve a problem (e.g., piling blocks to do addition). In the the representational stage, images are used to represent those objects, and in the final abstract stage, the learner uses numbers or symbols.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write each of the numbers 2, 7, 5, 10, 6 on a sticky note.</li>
<li>Simulate a loop that finds the largest value by looking at each in turn (concrete).</li>
<li>Sketch a diagram of the process you used, labelling each step (representational).</li>
<li>Write instructions that someone else could follow to go through the same steps you used (abstract).</li>
<li>Compare your representational and abstract materials with those of your partner.</li>
</ol>
