<h1 id="s:conduct">D) Code of Conduct</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>This code of conduct is based on the template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism Wiki</a>. We recommend that every online or in-person event adopt something like it, with the contact information filled in appropriately. Please see <a href="./joining.html#s:joining-covenant">SectionÂ C.1</a> for the covenant governing contributions to this material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form, including offensive communication, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</p>
<p>People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone violating these rules may be asked to leave the classroom at the sole discretion of the instructors.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it by emailing ADDRESS, or if the violation occurs during a workshop or other in-person event, by contacting the host directly at PHONE/TEXT. All reports will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
