Hundreds of grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach
programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to
[free-range learners](#g:free-range-learner) outside
traditional classrooms. These groups exist so that people don't have to
learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and
instructors are often teaching themselves how to teach.

## Who You Are {#s:intro-audience}

[s:process](#CHAPTER) and [s:joining](#CHAPTER)

I also recommend:

- [The Carpentries instructor
  training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), for
  which most of the first half of this book was originally developed.

- [[Lang2016](#CITE)] and [[Hust2012](#CITE)], which are short,
  approachable, and connect things you can do right now to the
  research that backs them.

- [[Majo2015](#CITE)], [[Broo2016](#CITE)] [[Berg2012](#CITE)], and
  [[Rice2018](#CITE)]. The first catalogs a hundred different kinds of
  exercises you can do with students; the second describes fifty
  different ways that groups can discuss things productively, while
  the third is a collection of patterns for teaching, and the fourth
  explains why to give learners breaks in class and ways to use them
  productively. These books can be used on their own, but I think they
  make more sense once Huston or Lang have given you a framework for
  understanding them.

- [[DeBr2015](#CITE)], which conveys a lot of what *is* true about
  educational by explaining what *isn't*, and [[Dida2016](#CITE)],
  which grounds learning theory in cognitive psychology.

- [[Pape1993](#CITE)], which remains an inspiring vision of how
  computers could change education.

- [[Gree2014](#CITE)], [[McMi2017](#CITE)] and [[Watt2014](#CITE)]. These
  three short books explain why so many attempts at educational reform
  have failed over the past forty years, how for-profit colleges are
  exploiting and exacerbating the growing inequality in our society,
  and how technology has repeatedly failed to revolutionize education.

- [[Guzd2015a](#CITE)], [[Hazz2014](#CITE)], and [[Sent2018](#CITE)],
  which are academically-oriented books I've found about teaching
  computing.

- [[Brow2007](#CITE)] and [[Mann2015](#CITE)], because you can't teach
  computing well without changing the system in which we teach, and
  you can't do that on your own.
