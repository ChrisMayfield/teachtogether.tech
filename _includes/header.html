                A growing number of people who work in tech want
                to be involved in progressive community change,
                but have never been part of grassroots initiatives
                before.

                This one-day hands-on workshop will show
                attendees how to figure out what their community
                actually needs, how to rally and organize
                volunteers, and how to build relationships with
                local institutions and like-minded groups.
