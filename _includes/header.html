            How do I find out what my community needs?
            How do I figure out who to talk to?

        <p>
          A growing number of people who work in tech want to be
          involved in progressive community change, but have never
          been part of grassroots initiatives before.
        </p>
        <p>
          This one-day hands-on workshop shows participants how to
          figure out what their community actually needs, how to rally
          and organize volunteers, and how to build relationships with
          local institutions and like-minded groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our next workshop will take place in June 2018.
          Please stay tuned for details.
