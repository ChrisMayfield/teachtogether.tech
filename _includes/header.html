          A growing number of people who work in tech want to be
          involved in progressive community change, but have never
          been part of grassroots initiatives before.
        </p>
        <p>
          This one-day hands-on workshop will show participants how to
          figure out what their community actually needs, how to rally
          and organize volunteers, and how to build relationships with
          local institutions and like-minded groups.
