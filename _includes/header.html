                    A growing number of people who work in tech want
                    to be involved in progressive community change,
                    but have never been part of grassroots initiatives
                    before.  This one-day hands-on workshop will show
                    attendees how to figure out what their community
                    actually needs, how to rally and organize
                    volunteers, and how to build relationships with
                    local institutions and like-minded groups.
